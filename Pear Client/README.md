To run Pear Client, you need to install Python ([*https://www.python.org/downloads/*](https://www.python.org/downloads/)***)***, and Java 21 ([https://download.oracle.com/java/21/latest/jdk-21\_windows-x64\_bin.exe](https://download.oracle.com/java/21/latest/jdk-21_windows-x64_bin.exe)).



1, Run the python installer and (important!) \*disable\* PATH limit of 256 characters.



2, Extract the "Pear-Client-main.zip" to just the C:\\ drive, launcher wants it there, so do it!



3, Open the .py file included with the install kit, wait for the assets and libraries to download and then enjoy!
